Electrum Crown is a fork of the open source Electrum Bitcoin wallet (www.electrum.org) for Crown.  The current
release is based on the Electrum 3.0.5 codebase with patches to

Version 1.0-beta

- handle Crown auxpow blocks
- handle Crown difficulty adjustment algorithm
- updated list of electrumx servers
- updated icons and branding
- use different directory for wallets and configuration

The Electrum Crown software is NOT affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Electrum, electrum.org or the Electrum
developers.

If you are concerned about running Electrum Crown binaries we recommend installing and/or running it from the github
source directly.


Usage
-----

When you first run Electrum Crown it will use a different configuration directory to Electrum.  On Unix it is
".electrum-crown", and on Windows/MacOS it is "ElectrumCrown".  Initially transactions will show
up as unverified because Electrum Crown is downloading the blockchain headers to verify the transactions.  This can take
up to 10 minutes, but is only done once.

Ensure you are running Electrum Crown and not Electrum by checking for "Electrum Crown" in the title bar wording.  Some
users installing from setup.py have reported conflicts if both Electrum and Electrum Crown are installed in parallel
that way.
